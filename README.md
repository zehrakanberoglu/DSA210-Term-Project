# DSA210-Term-Project
I am Zehra KanberoÄŸlu, a student at Sabanci University. In my DSA210 term project I decided to analyze my daily screen time data from both of my phone and computer, particularly the types of applications I use, such as social media and entertainment apps. In the second part, I will analyze my study habits, including total daily study time, the number of study sessions, and how frequently I check my devices while studying.  I will track my screen time on both my phone and computer, but I will manually collect all the data using an Excel format.

## MOTIVATION
As a university student who struggles to balance academic responsibilities with digital distractions, I often find myself thinking how my device usage affects my study habits. With increasing screen time, I suspect that my focus and productivity are being negatively impacted. My aim in maintaining this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how my daily screen time influence my study behavior. Specifically, I want to determine if increased screen time correlates with reduced study duration, fewer study sessions, or increased phone-checking frequency during study periods. 

## PROJECT GOAL
The goal of this project is to explore relatioship between screen time and study efficiency. I want to determine and create a balance between device spending time and studying time. I will collect the screen time and study behaviour data manually. By analyzing this data, I hope to identify patterns that could help optimize study habits and manage digital distractions effectively.
