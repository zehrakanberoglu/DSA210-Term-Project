# DSA210-Term-Project
I am Zehra KanberoÄŸlu a student at Sabanci University. Most of the university student having a struggle from waking up to early classes. I believe that poor quality or short sleep will negatively affect active participation in early classes. In my DSA210 term project I decided to analyze the relationship between my sleep schedule/sleep quality and my active attendance to my early hour classes. I will use the sleep tracker app for checking my sleep schedule but I will collect all the data manually.

##MOTIVATION
For university students, actively participating in classes and gaining efficiency from them can be difficult, especially without a proper sleep pattern. My motivation for this project is to analyze how sleep patterns affect my class attandence and efficiency. This study aims to highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy sleep schedule.

##PROJECT GOAL
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of sleep schedule and sleep quality on active participation in early-hour university classes. By tracking my sleep patterns using a sleep tracker app and collect all of the data manually. I aim to identify correlations between sleep habits and academic engagement. This study will help me understand the significance of maintaining a healthy sleep routine and its effects on learning efficiency, ultimately providing insights into how sleep influences student performance in morning classes.
